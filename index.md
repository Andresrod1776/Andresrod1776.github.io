### CPSC 120


* Lab 6, part 1


I really enjoyed part 1 of lab 6 working with my partner. We learned about indexes, and we were able to make a sandwich using ingredients. After completing the lab, I craved a ham sandwich and made one at home.


Lab 1


Lab 1 was the first ever lab I tried coding. It was complex for me as a non-computer science major with no experience in coding. It was also only one part, so that's why it was in my top 3.


Lab 4, part 2


For part 2, lab 4, I enjoyed the if statements throughout part 2. During Professor Shafae's lecture, he gave us examples of errors in the code on statements not being equal to one another. Once I opened the code, it was really clear to me.
